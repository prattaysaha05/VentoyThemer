## About

**VentoyThemer** is a graphical application for Windows designed to simplify the process of installing and managing themes for Ventoy. It allows you to easily add themes from various archive formats (ZIP, TAR.GZ, 7z, RAR, and others) or theme folders, manage theme settings (default theme, resolution), and remove installed themes from your Ventoy USB drive.

The application is written in Python using the Tkinter library and the TkinterDnD2 extension for Drag & Drop functionality.

## Features

* Automatic detection of connected Ventoy drives.
* Installation of themes from various archive formats (.zip, .tar.gz, .7z, .rar, etc.) or directly from a theme folder (containing `theme.txt`).
* Support for Drag & Drop of theme archives or folders.
* GUI-based configuration of the default theme and screen resolution.
* Removal of individual installed themes.
* Removal of all installed themes.
* Automatic updating of `ventoy.json` after theme installation/removal and settings changes.
* Multilingual interface (translations loaded from `languages.json`).

## Requirements (for running from source)

* Python 3.6 or higher.
* Required Python libraries:
    * `tkinter` (usually included with Python standard installation)
    * `tkinterdnd2`
    * `psutil`
    * `py7zr` (for .7z archives)
    * `rarfile` (for .rar archives, requires the `unrar` utility installed and available in your system's PATH)
    * `zstandard` (for .zst archives)
    * `lz4` (for .lz4 archives)
    * `pywin32` (for `win32api` and `win32file` modules, used for drive interaction on Windows)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tkinterdnd2 psutil py7zr rarfile zstandard lz4 pywin32
````
Note: For .rar archives, you might also need to install the `unrar` command-line utility on your operating system and ensure its directory is added to your system's PATH variable.

    * Click the "Browse" button and select one or more theme archives (.zip, .tar.gz, .7z, .rar, etc.) or theme folders (containing `theme.txt`).
    * Alternatively, simply Drag & Drop the theme archives or folders directly into the listbox area.
    * Selected items will appear in the list.
    * Click the "Apply Themes" button. The application will extract/copy the themes to the Ventoy drive and update the `ventoy.json` configuration.

## Building from Source (for Developers)

The application uses PyInstaller to create standalone executables.

1.  Install PyInstaller:
    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```
2.  Ensure you have all the necessary libraries installed to run the application from source (see Requirements section).
3.  Navigate to the root project folder in your terminal.
4.  Run the build script:
    ```bash
    python build.py
    ```
    This will create a `dist/VentoyThemer-[Version]/` folder containing the executable and all required files.
5.  Move the "VentoyThemer" folder from "_internal" to the root directory where the .exe file is located.

## Translations

The application supports a multilingual interface. All translations are stored in the `VentoyThemer/languages.json` file. If you would like to add a new language or improve an existing translation, you can edit this file and submit a Pull Request.

The `languages.json` file format is a JSON array, where each element in the array is a JSON object representing a language. Each object must contain a `"name"` key with the language name (e.g., "English", "Русский") and other key-value pairs for translating interface strings.
